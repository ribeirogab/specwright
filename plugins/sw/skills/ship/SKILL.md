# ship — the ladder, without stops

Run every step from intent to a reviewed pull request in one go, asking nothing
along the way. This is the same ladder as the individual commands — it does not
reimplement any step, it runs them back to back and takes on itself every
decision the interactive path would have handed to the maintainer.

**Announce at start:** "Shipping this end to end — I'll decide open questions and
record each one."

## The steps

Run these in order, each per its own skill. Follow that skill's instructions
exactly; the only difference is that you never stop to ask.

1. **`change`** — write `change.md` with acceptance criteria. If a change folder
   already exists for this work, start from it instead of writing a new one.
2. **`plan`** — write `plan.md` and pass the handoff-readiness validator.
3. **`implement`** — work the task list, quality gate, runtime verification.
4. **`pr`** — open the pull request with the verification record.
5. **`review`** — review the branch, fix what the findings justify, iterate to
   `lgtm`.

Then set `status: shipped` and the `shipped:` date in `change.md`, tick the
criteria that were verified, and commit on the change's own branch.

## Decide, then record

Every question the interactive ladder would have asked, you answer. Two rules:

**Prefer the reversible option.** When two designs are defensible, take the one
that is cheaper to undo. An autonomous run is not the place to make an expensive
bet on the maintainer's behalf.

**Record every decision in `change.md`.** Under `## Decisions and discoveries`,
one bullet each, saying what was chosen, why, and what was rejected:

```markdown
- **[decision]** Used cursor pagination instead of offset — the ticket did not
  specify and the table exceeds a million rows. Rejected: offset, which degrades
  with depth.
```

That section is the entire audit trail of an unattended run. A decision you took
and did not write down is indistinguishable from one you never noticed — treat an
unrecorded decision as a defect, not as tidiness.

Record `[discovery]` entries the same way: the non-obvious facts the work paid to
find, written so a future change can act on them.

## What still stops you

Autonomy covers design choices. It does not cover these:

- **Host policy.** File writes, command execution, Git actions, network calls,
  and external actions still obey the current host's sandbox and approval policy.
  Running unattended is not a permission bypass; ask when the host requires it.
- **The circuit breaker.** The same gate or criterion failing **three times
  identically** stops the run. Do not try a fourth variation of the same idea.
- **Verification you cannot perform.** A criterion you cannot execute is marked
  `needs-human-verification` in `change.md` with its reason. Never tick a
  criterion you did not observe, and never write a verification you did not run —
  autonomy makes this rule more important, not less, because nobody is watching.
- **An approved criterion.** Never edit an `AC-N` to match what you built.

On a stop, report: what failed, what you tried, and what you need. For a change
dispatched by a delivery, that is a `blocked` return with `status: blocked` set
in `change.md`.

## Then

Report the PR URL, the criteria verified and how, anything left
`needs-human-verification`, and the list of decisions you recorded. Read that
list back explicitly — it is the part the maintainer most needs to see, and the
part they had no chance to weigh in on.

Merging is theirs.
